## Why am I writing this

I think that everything... literally every action matters.

### Everything Matters

I do not know if this a radical idea. From my experience, I recall people saying to me... "it is fine", "it is good enough", "that doesn't matter"... I disagree.  To me, every individual detail matters until it can be proven to be unrelated to the action under consideration. The context of a situation or the state of an environment at any given state in time influences my mind.. and the mind of others subject to that state. 

### Everything is Sacred

Taking this one step further, I belive every single action and detail should be treated as holy. I am not really religious (says every religious man), but there is something to treating every single detail as sacred.  I was raised as a catholic.  I think back to the reverance to the host (until recently I had thought this to be absurd) I had exhibitted as a child.  I truly believed that the body of god was present in that bread. I think in a way it truly is.  

No I do not mean that the body and blood is physically transmutated... but by believing that it does might be a way to commune with god.

I do not know what I mean by god. I cannot rationalize anthropormorphic god. I cannot imagine a being with will... but I think there is something out there. I want to claim god is the eternal reason of the universe... but I do not mean this. I really do not know what is god.  

Anyways, due to the influence of others I forwent that reverence. I let myself approach the world in a way that treats objets as meaningless. That removes the blood and the toil required construct a glass bottle... to build and design a computer... I treat these things as disposable... In truth I think that a bit of our soul.. our lifeblood.. whatever is is imprinted upon it. It is unlikely that god has willed that to be. That we really possess a soul... but if I take one step away from religion.. the structures and systems that permit society and life to function are real.  A glass bottle for instance exists because of countless technological advances, social organization, toil, and the consumption of energy. Those interactions are just as real as the bottle itself. To seperate the two is I think a logical fault. 

Building upon this, all of the information exchanged to permit this bottle to exist as this moment in time is real. It still exists. That energy has passed elsewhere sure, but it exists in some way. There is a memory of it somewhere along the supply line.  There is some memory of a machine operator removing the silica from the earth.  I would like to eliminate these externalities from the being of the bottle.. but I do not think that is fair.  

So back to treating it as sacred. Why? I think the way I treat this inatimate object will reflect upon how I treat human beings, the environment, and animals.  I want to treat things as gifts to me. As sacred in a way. Yeah, I understand that there are things that are meant to be disposable... that change and entropy are constants that I cannot control.. Fair, but that said so are consequences. There is a consequence to treating things poorly. There is a consequence to treating people poorly.  There is a consequence to treating the environment poorly.

I do not know what means good nor evil. I do not even want to start down that path.... I think in simple terms what I am trying to convey is that there are consequences to every action. I better accept that truth in order to act accordingly. 

### Reflection

I just wrote. I will have to revisit this in the future. I am not sure if what I said is reasonable... I simply wrote what came to mind. I want to add one sentence to my arguement... Social constructs are real.
