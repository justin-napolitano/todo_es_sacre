This repository contains a personal reflective document titled "Everything Matters" authored by Justin Napolitano. The project appears to be a contemplative piece on the significance of details and reverence in everyday life, presented in Markdown format.

## Features

- A reflective essay emphasizing the importance of details and context.
- Written in Markdown with front matter metadata for easy integration into static site generators.
- Includes tags, categories, author information, and images references.

## Tech Stack

- Markdown for content formatting.
- Front matter in TOML format for metadata.

## Getting Started

Since this repository contains primarily a Markdown document, usage depends on your intended workflow. For example, to view or edit the content:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/todo_es_sacre.git

# Navigate into the repo
$ cd todo_es_sacre

# Open the index.md file in your preferred editor
$ code index.md  # or use vim, nano, etc.
```

If you want to render the Markdown with front matter, consider using a static site generator like Hugo or Jekyll.

## Project Structure

```
