I built the "todo_es_sacre" repository to explore the little things that matter in life. It’s not just another Markdown document—it's a reflective essay titled "Everything Matters." This piece dives into the significance of details and reverence in our everyday existence. It’s a project that’s both personal and profound.

## Why "todo_es_sacre" Exists

Life can be chaotic, and I often find myself caught up in the rush. I wanted to create something that anchors me back to what’s essential. "todo_es_sacre" serves as a reminder to slow down and appreciate the nuances around us. It’s not just about writing; it’s about embracing a mindset. Whether you believe in the power of reflection or not, there’s something invaluable about taking the time to consider what truly matters.

## Key Design Decisions

### Markdown & Front Matter

I chose Markdown for its simplicity and versatility. It’s lightweight and easy to work with, making it ideal for capturing my thoughts without getting bogged down in formatting. The front matter uses TOML format, which allows for a neat way to include metadata like:

- Tags
- Categories
- Author information
- Image references

By embedding this metadata, I make future integration with static site generators smoother and more efficient. 

### Structure

The project is straightforward. The main file, `index.md`, contains my reflective essay alongside its front matter. No unnecessary complexities here. Just pure content.

## Tech Stack

- **Markdown**: For formatting the essay.
- **TOML**: For front matter metadata.
  
I kept the tech stack minimal on purpose. It mirrors the essence of the project—focusing on the content rather than the tools.

## Getting Started

If you want to jump in and explore or modify the essay, here’s a quick guide:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/todo_es_sacre.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd todo_es_sacre
   ```

3. Open `index.md` in your favorite editor:
   ```bash
   code index.md  # Use vim, nano, or whatever you prefer.
   ```

Want to render the Markdown with its metadata? You might consider using a static site generator like Hugo or Jekyll to bring it to life online.

## Project Structure

Here’s the current layout:

```
index.md           # Main reflective essay with front matter metadata
```

It’s spare, but that’s the point. The content is king.

## Future Work / Roadmap

Like all projects, there's always room for improvement. Here’s what I envision for "todo_es_sacre":

- **Descriptive README**: Add context and goals of the project to help others understand its purpose better.
- **Content Expansion**: I’d like to include more essays or reflections that dive deeper into other aspects of life.
- **Static Site Integration**: I aim to set this up as a proper web presentation using a static site generator.
- **Enhanced Metadata**: More structured metadata would improve categorization and retrieval of content.
- **Translations**: Depending on demand, I might consider adding translations or related resources to make the content accessible to a larger audience.

## A Final Note

This project embodies a personal exploration more than a technical endeavor. I’m sharing updates and insights about it on social media platforms like Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter/X. Follow me there if you're interested in watching this project evolve!

In wrapping up, "todo_es_sacre" isn’t just a repository. It’s a journey of reflection, a quiet nudge to appreciate the details we often overlook. I hope you find something meaningful in it, too.
